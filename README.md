
# FlexiQuiz v1.2

## Project Overview

**FlexiQuiz** is a web application for creating, importing, and taking interactive quizzes. It supports multiple question types and offers two correction modes to suit your learning needs.

---

## Version & Features

**Version: 1.1**

- **Instant Answer Mode**: Validate each question with Submit, then Next to move on.
- **Review at End Mode**: Get feedback for all questions at the end of the quiz.
- **Automatic hiding** of Next buttons and feedback during review.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Quickly select options (1-9), validate (Space/Enter).

---

## Newly added

- **Import multiple quizzes at once**: select one or more JSON files or a whole folder of quiz files; all valid JSON quizzes are loaded and added to the quizzes list.
- **Quiz selection UI**: imported quizzes are stored in a selectable list; you can pick which quiz to start from the imported set (the example quiz is added by default).
- **Import confirmation modal**: importing uses a small modal that lets you choose whether to import a single file or a folder (improves UX compared to a plain confirm()).
- **Save & resume sessions (localStorage)**: sessions are periodically saved (including answers, index, time left and mode). If a saved active session exists, the app offers to resume it on load.
- **Persistent theme**: the chosen light/dark theme is remembered in localStorage and applied on next visits. If no theme is stored, the OS preference is used.
- **Automatic input locking after answer**: once an answer is submitted for a question inputs are disabled to prevent accidental changes during the same session.
- **Export buttons hidden on session start**: when a session starts export controls are hidden to avoid accidental export during a live quiz.

## How to Create a Quiz File

- **Format**: JSON
- **File name**: `myquiz.json` (avoid spaces and special characters)
- **Structure:**
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Quiz Title",
    "questions": [
      { /* question 1 */ },
      { /* question 2 */ }
    ]
  }
  ```
- Each question object must follow the structure for its type.

2. **Choose the mode**: Instant Answer or Review at End.
3. **Start the session**.

```

## Generate a Quiz from a PDF

**Example AI prompt:**

You are a FlexiQuiz JSON generator. Instructions:

1. Make questions from the PDF (`ucq`, `mcq`, `text`, `number`).
2. Before generating, ask the user if they want a theme, a question limit, or special requirements.
3. Do not include a `title` field; use the file name as the quiz title.
4. Each question object:
   - `type`: `ucq`, `mcq`, `text`, or `number`
   - `q`: question text
   - `options`: array (for `ucq`/`mcq` only)
   - `answer`: index, array, string, or number
   - `explanation`: optional
5. Output only a JSON array of questions.

Example:
```json
[
  {"q": "What is a protocol?", "type": "ucq", "options": ["File", "Rules", "Device"], "answer": 1},
  {"q": "How many OSI layers?", "type": "number", "answer": 7},
  {"q": "Protocol for email?", "type": "text", "answer": "SMTP"}
  {"q": "Which are JavaScript frameworks?", "type": "mcq", "options": ["React", "Django", "Vue", "Laravel"], "answer": [0, 2], "explanation": "React and Vue are JavaScript frameworks."}
]
```
No title field, no extra metadata. The file name is the quiz title.

## Usage Tips

- **Validate your JSON** before importing (use [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com)).
- **Name your files** without spaces or special characters.
- **Write clear and precise questions.**
- **Try both modes** to vary your learning.
- **Use keyboard shortcuts** to save time.
